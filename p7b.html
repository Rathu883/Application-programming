<div id ="embedded-box">
<p>Although real pets are lovable, as per pet-bot developers, they have a few setbacks. Real pets need to be taken care of, such as feeding and cleaning them up. AI pets will be robots that look, feel, and act like a real animal but eliminate such issues faced by owners. It is expected that AI-driven pets will be widely available in the market by 2025.  </p>

<p>As early as by the end of 2018, it was expected that robotic assistants would be able to carry out voice recognition. The primary purpose of artificial intelligence is for humans or businesses to have a machine that thinks faster and more efficiently. But the question becomes, in this process, will advancements in technology take over the world? Will it help humankind reach the highest potential or destroy it in the process? Well, in January 2018, Google CEO Sundar Pichai claimed that artificial intelligence would be more transformative to humanity than electricity. Mckinsey report reveals that global demand for data scientists will exceed supply by more than 50% in 2018. On the other hand, PWC predicted that the global GDP could rise by 14% as a result of AI-powered activities by 2030, which is equal to US$15.7 trillion.Disclaimer: Any financial and crypto market information given on Analytics Insight are sponsored articles, written for informational purpose only and is not an investment advice.

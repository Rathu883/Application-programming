The BMW X1 is a line of cars produced by German marque BMW since 2009. It is in the subcompact luxury crossover class, and the first-generation X1 was based on the E90 3 Series and offered rear-wheel drive layout as standard. At its introduction in 2009, it was positioned as the smallest SUV in BMW line-up, below the X3 prior to the launch of the smaller X1. The X1 essentially is aiming a wider range of customers due to its smaller size, increased efficiency, and a lower price tag due to the all-wheel drive layout (xDrive) being optional.

The second-generation X1 marked the switch to a front-wheel-drive-based layout using the UKL2 platform shared with the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and the Mini Countryman.[1] Despite its name, it is now only the second smallest SUV produced by BMW since the introduction of the X2.[2]

<h1>Truth of kaliyug </h1>
<p> According to Vedic calculations, we are now in Kali Yuga, a non-spiritual age of ignorance, sin, and short life. The other three eras are Satya Yuga (Age of Wisdom and Truth), Treta Yuga (Age of Silver), and Dwapara Yuga (Age of Bronze). In “Brahma Vaivarta Purana”, Lord Krishna said that the Kali era would end 5,000 years later, ushering in the golden age.

Hinduism believes that human civilization was spiritually degraded during the Kali Yuga era. This era is called the Dark Age because people are as far away from God as possible.</p>

<p>A year (of men) is equal to a day and night of the gods ... (19) I shall, in their order, tell you the number of years that are for different purposes calculated differently, in the Krita, the Treta, the Dwapara, and the Kali yugas. (20) Four thousand celestial years is the duration of the first or Krita age. The morning of that cycle consists of four hundred years and its evening is of four hundred years. (21) Regarding the other cycles, the duration of each gradually decreases by a quarter in respect of both the principal period with the minor portion and the conjoining portion itself. </p>

<p> A year is a day and a night of the gods ... (68) But hear now the brief (description of) the duration of a night and a day of Brahman [(Brahma)] and of the several ages (of the world, yuga) according to their order. (69) They declare that the Krita age (consists of) four thousand years (of the gods); the twilight preceding it consists of as many hundreds, and the twilight following it of the same number. (70) In the other three ages with their twilights preceding and following, the thousands and hundreds are diminished by one (in each). </p>
